stylebot-solarized
==================

To install:
-----------

1. Install the
[stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha)
extension for Chrome.

2. Navigate to the
[raw style.json file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesB797/stylebot-solarized/master/style.json)

3. Press Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C to copy all of the text on the page.

4. Click on the 'CSS' icon next to the omnibar. If it isn't there,
   it's probably because you're still on the raw json
   page. Stylebot doesn't activate on such pages, so navigate back
   to this github page so that the 'CSS' icon will show up.

5. Click on 'Options...' in the resulting popup.

6. Click on 'Backup' in the sidebar on the left side of the page.

7. Click on the 'Import Styles...' button.

8. Paste the text into the resulting text box with Ctrl+V.

9. Click the Import button.

After clicking the 'Import' button, the dialog should close itself
and the installation will be complete.
